Welcome to the Canari Framework - the world's most advanced rapid transform development framework for Maltego. In this
quickstart tutorial we'll go over how you can take advantage of Canari's powerful feature set to create your own Maltego
transform package. We'll start by developing a local transform package and then migrate that over to a remote transform
package which you can distributed via the `Paterva TDS <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/>`_. Enough jibber jabber and
let's get this show on the road.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------
Canari requires the following dependencies to get started:

    #. Python 2.7 or later (prior to Python 3) - `Download <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
    #. setuptools - `Download <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads>`_
    #. virtualenv - `Download <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv#downloads>`_

.. note::

    Canari does not support Python version 3.

Installing Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Linux Debian-based**

On Debian-based (Ubuntu, Kali, etc.) systems, all these dependencies can be installed using :program:`apt-get`::

    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-virtualenv python-setuptools

**Linux - Fedora-based**

On Fedora-based (Fedora, RedHat, CentOS, etc.) systems, all these dependencies can be installed using :program:`yum`::

    $ sudo yum groupinstall -y 'development tools'
    $ sudo yum install zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel \
         readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel python-devel
    $ sudo easy_install virtualenv

**Mac OS/X**

On Mac OS/X, make sure to install `Xcode <https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>`_ from the App Store,
first. Then install the command-line tools like so::

    $ sudo xcode-select --install
    $ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-18.4.tar.gz
    $ tar -zxvf setuptools-18.4.tar.gz
    $ cd setuptools-18.4 && sudo python setup.py install
    $ sudo easy_install virtualenv

**Windows**

It is highly recommended to install `ActivePython 3.x <https://www.activestate.com/products/activepython/downloads/>`_ as it provides a number of pre-compiled modules and great support.

Installing Canari
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you have all your dependencies installed, you can now install Canari. We recommend creating a virtual environment
to reduce clutter in your default Python site-package directory. Virtual environments can be created easily like so::

    $ virtualenv canari3
    New python executable in canari3/bin/python
    Installing setuptools, pip...done.

This will create a completely separate Python environment in the ``canari3`` directory, which you can use to install
custom Python libraries to without the risk of corrupting your default Python environment. Another advantage to virtual
environments is that they can be easily cleaned up if you no longer need them. To activate your virtual environment, do
the following::

    $ source canari3/bin/activate
    $ which python
    canari3/bin/python
    
To activate your virtual environment in Windows, do the following::
    
    > .\canari3\Scripts\activate

.. attention::

    Virtual environments need to be activated every time you create a new terminal session. Otherwise, you'll be using
    the default Python installation. You can automate this process by adding the ``source`` statement above in your
    ``.profile`` or ``.bashrc`` file.

Once you've activated your virtual environment, it is now time to install Canari::

    $ pip install canari

.. note::

    One of the advantages of virtual environments is that you no longer have to use :program:`sudo` to install custom
    Python modules.

Now you're all set to get started developing your first transform package!


Hello World!
------------
Let's start by creating our first transform package. This will include an example "Hello World!" transform for your
convenience. To create a transform package we use the :program:`canari` commander like so::

    $ canari create-package hello
    creating skeleton in hello
    --> Project description: My first transform package

    --> Author name [ndouba]:

    --> Author email: myemail@foo.com

    done!
    $

The ``create-package`` commandlet creates the skeleton for your transform package. It starts off by asking you some
standard information about the package and uses that information to populate authorship information in your transform
code.

.. note::

    The :program:`canari` commander has many other commandlets that you can take advantage of. For a full list of
    commands take a look at the output of :program:`canari list-commands`.

If your transform package was successfully created, you should now see a ``hello`` folder in your working directory::

    $ ls
    hello ...

Let's drop into that directory and run our first transform. As mentioned earlier, each time you create a new transform
package, a "Hello World!" transform gets created for your reference. We'll execute this transform using the
:program:`canari debug-transform` transform runner::

    $ cd hello/src
    $ canari debug-transform hello.transforms.helloworld.HelloWorld Bob
    `- MaltegoTransformResponseMessage:
      `- UIMessages:
      `- Entities:
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.Phrase'}
          `- Value: Hello Bob!
          `- Weight: 1
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.Phrase'}
          `- Value: This way Mr(s). None!
          `- Weight: 1
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.Phrase'}
          `- Value: Hi None!
          `- Weight: 1

You'll probably see the output above and you may be wondering why are we seeing ``None`` in places where we'd expect to
see ``Bob``. This is because the example transform also demonstrates the use of transform fields. Go ahead and open the
transform in your favorite text editor located at ``src/hello/transforms/helloworld.py`` - you should see the following::

    class HelloWorld(Transform):
        # The transform input entity type.
        input_type = Person # <------------------------------------------------ 1

        def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
            person = request.entity
            response += Phrase('Hello %s!' % person.value)
            response += Phrase('This way Mr(s). %s!' % person.lastname) # <---- 2
            response += Phrase('Hi %s!' % person.firstnames) # <--------------- 3
            return response

In our example, the :class:`HelloWorld` transform expects an input type of :class:`Person` (1). If we look in
:meth:`HelloWorld.do_transform` we see that it references the ``person.lastname`` (2) and ``person.firstnames`` (3)
entity fields. Let's pass these fields to our transform runner::

    $ canari debug-transform hello.transforms.helloworld.HelloWorld Bob "person.lastname=Doe#person.firstnames=Bob"
    `- MaltegoTransformResponseMessage:
      `- UIMessages:
      `- Entities:
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.Phrase'}
          `- Value: Hello Bob!
          `- Weight: 1
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.Phrase'}
          `- Value: This way Mr(s). Doe!
          `- Weight: 1
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.Phrase'}
          `- Value: Hi Bob!
          `- Weight: 1

.. note::

    In this case, the entity field names coincidentally matched the names in our code example above. However, this will
    not always be the case. Take a look at the :mod:`canari.maltego.entities` file for a full set of builtin Maltego
    entity definitions and their fields.

Now that we've run our first transform successfully and understand the use of transform fields, let's create our first
custom transform.

Your First Transform
--------------------

Using the same package above, in our ``hello`` directory, let's start off by creating a transform using the
:program:`canari create-transform` commandlet, like so::

    $ canari create-transform whatismyip
    Creating transform 'whatismyip'...
    done!

As you may have guessed already, we are going to write a transform that determines our current Internet IP address.
Let's use the free JSON API at `ipify <https://www.ipify.org/>`_. First let's make sure you can reach the server by
clicking `here <https://api.ipify.org?format=json>`_ or typing the following in your terminal::

    $ curl 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'
    {"ip":"123.123.123.123"}

You should see something like the output above, except your IP address would appear in place of "123.123.123.123".
Great! Let's write the transform with the following design principles:

    #.  Our transform will expect a ``Location`` entity as input.
    #.  Our transform will return an ``IPv4Address`` entity as output.

Let's go ahead and open our ``src/hello/transforms/whatismyip.py`` transform and implement the code::

    from urllib import urlopen
    import json

    from canari.maltego.entities import IPv4Address, Location
    from canari.maltego.transform import Transform
    from canari.framework import EnableDebugWindow

    @EnableDebugWindow
    class Whatismyip(Transform):
        """Returns my Internet IP Address"""

        input_type = Location

        def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
            ip_json = requests.get('https://api.ipify.org?format=json') # <- 1
            ip_address = json.loads(ip_json.text)['ip'] # <----------------- 2
            response += IPv4Address(ip_address) # <------------------------- 3
            return response # <--------------------------------------------- 4

        def on_terminate(self):
            """This method gets called when transform execution is prematurely terminated. It is only applicable for local
            transforms. It can be excluded if you don't need it."""
            pass


The ``input_type`` class property tells Canari to expect an input entity of type ``Location``. This ensures that the
transform will only appear in the context menu of a ``Location`` entity in Maltego (i.e. under the run transform menu
options). Here's what's going on line-by-line inside the :meth:`do_transform()`:

    #.  First we make our request to ``ipify`` and get our IP address as a JSON string
    #.  We parse the JSON we got from ``ipify`` (i.e. ``{"ip":"123.123.123.123"}``) and extract our IP address.
    #.  We then create an ``IPv4Address`` entity with the default value set to our IP address and append it to our response.
    #.  Finally we return the response to Maltego.

Let's see if our transform is operating correctly::

    $ cd src
    $ canari debug-transform hello.transforms.whatismyip.Whatismyip Home
    `- MaltegoTransformResponseMessage:
      `- UIMessages:
      `- Entities:
        `- Entity:  {'Type': 'maltego.IPv4Address'}
          `- Value: 216.48.160.29
          `- Weight: 1

Great! Let's try this out in Maltego. First we need to create a profile that can be imported by Maltego to configure the
transforms in the GUI::

    $ canari create-profile hello
    Looking for transforms in hello...
    Package loaded.
    Creating profile ~/hello/src/hello.mtz...
    Installing transform hello.HelloWorld from hello.transforms.helloworld.HelloWorld...
    Installing transform hello.Whatismyip from hello.transforms.whatismyip.Whatismyip...
    Writing ~/hello/src/hello/resources/etc/hello.conf to /Users/ndouba/tools/canari3/build/hello/src/hello.conf
    Updating ~/hello/src/canari.conf...
    Writing transform set Hello to ~/hello/src/hello.mtz...
    Writing transform set Canari to ~/hello/src/hello.mtz...
    Writing server Local to ~/hello/src/hello.mtz

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUCCESS! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

     Successfully created /Users/ndouba/tools/canari3/build/hello/src/hello.mtz. You may now import this file into
     Maltego.

     INSTRUCTIONS:
     -------------
     1. Open Maltego.
     2. Click on the home button (Maltego icon, top-left corner).
     3. Click on 'Import'.
     4. Click on 'Import Configuration'.
     5. Follow prompts.
     6. Enjoy!

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUCCESS! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This should have created a ``hello.mtz`` file in the directory where you ran the command. Let's import this profile into
Maltego:

    #. Open Maltego.
    #. Click on the Maltego home button (big Maltego icon in the top left corner).
    #. Navigate to ``Import`` then click on ``Import Configuration``
    #. Select your ``hello.mtz`` file and accept the defaults in the wizard.

        Maltego ``Import Profile`` menu option

.. warning::

    Canari Maltego profile files are not redistributable. This is because the path of your local transforms and Canari
    framework files will vary across systems. Instead, developers of local transforms should always include the Canari
    ``create-profile`` instructions as part of the transform package's installation steps.

Once you've successfully imported your profile, create a new graph and drag a ``Location`` entity onto the graph. Then
right click on the newly created ``Location`` entity, look for the ``Hello`` transform set, and click ``Whatismyip``.

    .. figure:: images/maltego_run_transform.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Maltego Run Transform

        Maltego run transform steps

If all went well you should now see your IP address magically appear on the graph right below your ``Location`` entity.

.. note::

    If you're familiar with Canari v1 you may have noticed a few of Canari v3's awesome features at work. One of them is
    that the transform set and transform name in the Maltego UI are derived from the Canari package and transform names,
    respectively. If you dig a little deeper, you may also notice that the transform description is derived from the
    transform class' ``__doc__`` string property.

Let's say you wanted to change the name of the transform as it appears in Maltego. There are two ways of doing this:

    #. You can adjust the transform class' name into camel case (i.e. ``Whatismyip`` to ``WhatIsMyIP``). This will
       tell Canari to insert a space between each uppercase letter in the transform's name in Maltego.
    #. You can set the transform class' ``display_name`` property to the label of your choice.

Let's try it out by subclassing the :class:`Whatismyip` and adding the following lines to the end of the
``src/hello/transforms/whatismyip.py`` file::

    class ToMyIP(Whatismyip):
        pass

After you've saved your changes, recreate your Maltego profile using the :program:`canari create-profile hello` command,
re-import the configuration into Maltego, and run the transform like before. You should now see a ``To My IP`` transform
in the transform context menu.

    .. figure:: images/maltego_transform_friendly_name.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Transform user-friendly name

        Transform user-friendly name.

The previous example demonstrated the use of subclassing to reuse transform code. Subclassing a transform is useful when
you want to reuse transform logic that could be applied to other entity types as well. For example, say you have a nifty
threat intelligence transform that could be run on either an IP address or a DNS name. Instead of copying and pasting
the same code over and over again, you can simply implement it once, subclass the original transform, and adjust the
``input_type`` property to the desired type in the child class. Let's say we wanted :class:`ToMyIP` in our previous
example to only apply to ``Phrase`` entities then we'd adjust the code, like so::

    class ToMyIP(Whatismyip):
        # don't forget to import maltego.entities.Phrase
        input_type = Phrase

Finally, you may have noticed that we completely ignored the value of the input entity in this example. This is because
our transform didn't need to use your location's name in order to get your IP address. Let's create another transform,
except this time we'll use the information passed into the transform by the input entity.

.. note::

    You may be wondering if you have to recreate and re-import Maltego profiles each time you make a transform change.
    The answer is yes and no. If you are only updating the behaviour (i.e. body of the :meth:`do_transform` method) of
    your transform, the answer is no. However, if you want to adjust things such as the display name, the transform
    class name, transform description, transform set name, then the answer is yes. Often times you will find yourself
    recreating the profile and reinstalling it whenever you add or rename a transform in your package.

Working With Input Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we know how to return entities to Maltego, let's take a look at how to receive input. In this example we'll use
the `FreeGeoIP <https://freegeoip.net>`_ JSON API to get the country, city, and region associated with an IP address.
The transform will be designed with the following design principles:

    #. The transform will accept an ``IPv4Address`` as input.
    #. The transform will return a ``Location`` entity as output.


First let's create our transform by running :program:`canari create-transform IPToLocation` in your terminal::

    $ canari create-transform IPToLocation
    Creating transform 'iptolocation'...
    done!

.. note::

    This time we've passed the name of the transform in camel case to the ``create-transform`` command to avoid having
    to change it later.

Next, let's edit the ``src/hello/transforms/iptolocation.py`` file and implement our transform logic::

    import json
    from urllib import urlopen

    from canari.framework import EnableDebugWindow
    from canari.maltego.entities import IPv4Address, Location
    from canari.maltego.transform import Transform


    @EnableDebugWindow
    class IPToLocation(Transform):
        """Get's the city/country associated with a particular IP address."""

        # The transform input entity type.
        input_type = IPv4Address

        def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
            ip_address = request.entity.value # <----------------------- 1

            geoip_str = urlopen('https://freegeoip.net/json/%s' % ip_address).read()
            geoip_json = json.loads(geoip_str)

            l = Location()
            l.country = geoip_json.get('country_name', 'Unknown') # <--- 2
            l.city = geoip_json.get('city')
            l.countrycode = geoip_json.get('country_code')
            l.latitude = geoip_json.get('latitude')
            l.longitude = geoip_json.get('longitude')
            l.area = geoip_json.get('region_name')

            response += l
            return response

As you can see, the first line (1) in our :meth:`do_transform` method retrieves the display value of our input entity
and stores it in the ``ip_address`` variable. The display value is the value that is shown below the entity's icon in
the Maltego GUI. For example, the display value for an ``IPv4Address`` entity in Maltego is an IP V4 address
(i.e. ``192.168.0.1``). The ``request`` object is where all Maltego request information is stored and has the following
properties:

    #. The input entity and its fields are stored in the ``entity`` property; its type is determined by the
       value of your transform's ``input_type``.
    #. The ``parameters`` property returns a list of transform parameters. When Canari is operating in local
       transform mode, this property contains the unparsed command line arguments. In remote operating mode,
       the transform parameters passed in by the Maltego client are stored.
    #. The ``limits`` property returns the transforms soft and hard limit. This property is not applicable in local
       transform mode as Maltego's local transform adapter doesn't pass in this information.

Next we issue our request to FreeGeoIP for the requested IP address and convert the JSON response into a python
dictionary. The ``Location`` entity is then initialized (2) and its respective field values are then set to the values
retrieved from our JSON object. Finally, we append the entity to our ``response`` object and return the output to
Maltego.

.. note::
    The default value of a ``Location`` entity in Maltego's GUI is calculated based on the values of the city and
    country name entity fields. Therefore, setting a default value for a ``Location`` entity has no effect and is
    unnecessary.

In our previous example, we illustrated how to set the values of our output entity's fields using the property setters
(i.e. ``l.country = 'CA'``). However, we can also set these entity fields by passing them in as keyword arguments. Let's
refactor the code in the :meth:`IPToLocation.do_transform` method to demonstrate this feature::


    def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
        ip_address = request.entity.value

        geoip_str = urlopen('https://freegeoip.net/json/%s' % ip_address).read()
        geoip_json = json.loads(geoip_str)

        response += Location(
            country=geoip_json.get('country_name', 'Unknown'),
            city=geoip_json.get('city'),
            countrycode=geoip_json.get('country_code'),
            latitude=geoip_json.get('latitude'),
            longitude=geoip_json.get('longitude'),
            area=geoip_json.get('region_name')
        )

        return response

Let's say we wanted to add a little more information or color to our graphs. Maltego supports both link and entity
decorations. Labels, colors, thicknesses and styles can be applied to the links or edges connecting the output
entities to their parent input entities. Entities can be bookmarked (or starred) and comments can be attached. Let's add
a link label and bookmark the ``Location`` entity returned in our previous example::

    def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
        # don't forget to add `from maltego.message import Bookmark`
        ip_address = request.entity.value

        geoip_str = urlopen('https://freegeoip.net/json/%s' % ip_address).read()
        geoip_json = json.loads(geoip_str)

        response += Location(
            country=geoip_json.get('country_name', 'Unknown'),
            city=geoip_json.get('city'),
            countrycode=geoip_json.get('country_code'),
            latitude=geoip_json.get('latitude'),
            longitude=geoip_json.get('longitude'),
            area=geoip_json.get('region_name'),
            link_label='From FreeGeoIP',
            bookmark=Bookmark.Orange
        )

        return response

Let's take a look at the before and after difference:

    .. figure:: images/maltego_add_decorations.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Maltego Link Label and Bookmark

        Entity with link label and bookmark (left) versus undecorated entity (right)

Finally, let's add an icon to our output entity. Since we're working with locations, we'll set the output entity's icon
to the flag that corresponds with the country code::

    def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
        # don't forget to add `from maltego.message import Bookmark`
        ip_address = request.entity.value

        geoip_str = urlopen('https://freegeoip.net/json/%s' % ip_address).read()
        geoip_json = json.loads(geoip_str)

        country_code = geoip_json.get('country_code').lower()

        response += Location(
            country=geoip_json.get('country_name', 'Unknown'),
            city=geoip_json.get('city'),
            countrycode=country_code,
            latitude=geoip_json.get('latitude'),
            longitude=geoip_json.get('longitude'),
            area=geoip_json.get('region_name'),
            link_label='From FreeGeoIP',
            bookmark=Bookmark.Orange,
            icon_url='http://www.geoips.com/assets/img/flag/256/%s.png' % country_code
        )

        return response

Now that we've covered the ``request`` and ``response`` parameters, let's take a look at the ``config`` parameter and
how we can use it to make our transforms configurable.

Using Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you're familiar with the request and response architecture in Canari, let's make our transforms configurable.
Let's assume we want to store the URL to our GeoIP API endpoint for our ``IPToLocation`` in a configuration file. First,
let's open the ``src/hello/resources/etc/hello.conf`` file in a text editor. You'll notice a bunch of default values in
the configuration file::

    [hello.local]

    # TODO: put local transform options here

    [hello.remote]

    # TODO: put remote transform options here

Just like an INI file in Windows, each Canari configuration file is made up of sections whose names appear within square
brackets (``[``, ``]``), and options that appear as name-value pairs under each section header (``opt_name=opt_value``).
Let's add our FreeGeoIP endpoint URL configuration option in the configuration file::

    [hello.local]

    geo_ip_url=https://freegeoip.net/json/{ip}

    [hello.remote]

    # TODO: put remote transform options here

Now let's refactor our :meth:`IPToLocation.do_transform` code to query the configuration file for our API endpoint URL::

    def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
        ip_address = request.entity.value

        url_template = config['hello.local.geo_ip_url'] # <------------ 1

        geoip_str = urlopen(url_template.format(ip=ip_address)).read()
        geoip_json = json.loads(geoip_str)

        country_code = geoip_json.get('country_code').lower()

        response += Location(
            country=geoip_json.get('country_name', 'Unknown'),
            city=geoip_json.get('city'),
            countrycode=country_code,
            latitude=geoip_json.get('latitude'),
            longitude=geoip_json.get('longitude'),
            area=geoip_json.get('region_name'),
            link_label='From FreeGeoIP',
            bookmark=Bookmark.Orange,
            icon_url='http://www.geoips.com/assets/img/flag/256/%s.png' % country_code
        )

        return response

As demonstrated, above, the ``config`` behaves just like a python dictionary; the keys are derived by appending the
option name to the section name using a period (``.``). We've now covered all the basics for local transform development
but what if we wanted to make our transforms remotely accessible?

Making Transforms Remote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're using Maltego Chlorine or later, you will probably be familiar with the Transform Hub (figure below) that
appears as soon as Maltego is opened in the "Home" tab. The transform hub provides access to transforms provided by
several providers. These providers operate transform application servers that host remotely accessible transforms or
remote transforms.

        Maltego Transform Hub

Take a look at Paterva's `documentation <https://www.paterva.com/web6/products/servers.php>`_ on how remote transforms
work. As can be seen in the figure below, remote transform requests are proxied via a transform distribution server
(or TDS). The TDS hosts a Maltego configuration profile that can be imported into the client via a "seed" URL. The seed
URL is unique to each set of remote transforms and can be created via the web-based TDS administration console.

        Maltego TDS infrastructure.

In order to run our transforms remotely, you need to have access to a TDS. You can either buy your own TDS from Paterva
if you wish to keep your data private or use their `public TDS <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/>`_. Since we're not
dealing with sensitive data in our examples, we'll use the public TDS server. Before we start, you'll need to `register
an account <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/register/>`_ with Paterva's public TDS. Once you've registered for a free
account, login to make sure you can access the console.

Great! Now that you're setup with a free TDS account, let's go ahead and create our first seed:

    #.  Click on `Seeds <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/seeds>`_
    #.  Then `Add Seed <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/seeds/add>`_
    #.  Leave all fields as-is and click ``Add Seed`` at the bottom of the form. This will save a new seed called
        ``MySeed`` that we'll populate with transforms later. Take note of the ``Seed URL`` for now as we'll be using it
        later.

Now that we've created our seed, we can now configure our remote transforms. First, we'll setup our remote transform
application server, Plume, on an Internet accessible system. Plume is Canari's remote transform runner and can be used
to host and execute the same transforms you wrote earlier with minor modifications to their code. Let's take our IP to
location transform and make it a remote transform::

    import json
    from urllib import urlopen

    from canari.framework import EnableDebugWindow
    from canari.maltego.entities import IPv4Address, Location
    from canari.maltego.transform import Transform


    @EnableDebugWindow
    class IPToLocation(Transform):
        """Get's the city/country associated with a particular IP address."""

        # The transform input entity type.
        input_type = IPv4Address

        # Make our transform remote
        remote = True # <------------ 1

        def do_transform(self, request, response, config):
            ip_address = request.entity.value

            url_template = config['hello.local.geo_ip_url'] # <------------ 1

            geoip_str = urlopen(url_template.format(ip=ip_address)).read()
            geoip_json = json.loads(geoip_str)

            country_code = geoip_json.get('country_code').lower()

            response += Location(
                country=geoip_json.get('country_name', 'Unknown'),
                city=geoip_json.get('city'),
                countrycode=country_code,
                latitude=geoip_json.get('latitude'),
                longitude=geoip_json.get('longitude'),
                area=geoip_json.get('region_name'),
                link_label='From FreeGeoIP',
                bookmark=Bookmark.Orange,
                icon_url='http://www.geoips.com/assets/img/flag/256/%s.png' % country_code
            )

            return response

By simply setting the class property ``remote`` to ``True`` (1) we have now told Plume that this transform can be run
remotely. If you need, for example, an apikey from a user, configured as TDS Transform Settings, you can access the 
values using `request.parameters['apikey'].value` for example. Now all we have to do is install Canari, Plume, and our 
transform package on the Internet-accessible server.
Follow the same steps to install Canari on your remote transform server as mentioned in the :ref:`Installation` section.
Now archive and upload your ``hello`` Canari package to the server and run the :program:`python setup.py install`
script::

    $ python setup.py sdist
    $ scp dist/hello-1.0.tar.gz root@server:.

.. note::

    Plume is only compatible with UNIX-based systems such as Linux, BSD, Darwin, etc. Windows support has not been
    implemented yet.

Run :program:`canari install-plume` and step through the installation wizard on your server. You can simply accept all
the defaults (in square brackets) by pressing enter. Here's an example of a successful Plume install::

    server$ canari install-plume
    --> What directory would you like to install the Plume init script in? [/etc/init.d]:

    --> What directory would you like to use as the Plume root directory? [/var/plume]:

    --> What directory would you like to save Plume logs in? [/var/log]:

    --> What directory would you like to save the Plume PID file in? [/var/run]:

    --> What user would you like Plume to run as? [nobody]:

    --> What group would you like Plume to run as? [nobody]:

    --> What port would you like Plume to listen on? [8080]:

    --> Would you like Plume to use TLS? [n]:

    --> Canari has detected that you're running this install script from within a virtualenv.
    --> Would you like to run Plume from this virtualenv ('~/venvs/canari') as well? [Y/n]:
    Writing canari.conf to '/var/plume'...
    done!

The Plume root directory (`/var/plume`) is where you will be running the :program:`canari load-plume-package` or
:program:`canari unload-plume-package` commands. It's also where the `canari.conf` file for Plume will be stored as well
as any static resources your transform package may rely on. Make note of the path you used for the Plume root directory
as we'll be using it later::

    server$ export PLUME_ROOT=/var/plume

Next, decompress your ``hello-1.0.tar.gz`` archive and run :program:`python setup.py install` from within the ``hello/``
directory. At this point all our dependencies have been installed and all we need to do is configure Plume to load the
Canari transform package::

    server$ cd $PLUME_ROOT
    server$ canari load-plume-package hello
    Looking for transforms in hello...
    Package loaded.
    /var/plume/canari.conf already exists. Would you like to overwrite it? [y/N]:
    Please restart plume for changes to take effect.

At this point, we are ready to go and all we have to do is run our init script (i.e. :program:`/etc/init.d/plume start`)
from the init script directory::

    server$ /etc/init.d/plume start
    Starting plume: non-SSL server
    Looking for transforms in hello...
    Package loaded.
    Loading transform package 'hello'
    Loading transform 'hello.IPToLocation' at /hello.IPToLocation...
    done.

At this point what need to do is add our transform to our seed on the Paterva community TDS server:

    #. Go back to the `TDS console <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/>`_ in your browser and login, if required.
    #. Click on `Transforms <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/transforms>`_.
    #. Click on `Add Transform <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/transforms/add>`_.
    #. Set the following values:

        a. `Transform Name` to ``IPToLocation``.
        b. `Tranform UI Display` to ``IP To Location``.
        c. `Transform URL` to ``http://<server IP or hostname>:<port>/hello.IPToLocation``.
        d. Select the ``Paterva Entities`` radio button then ``maltego.IPv4Address`` from the drop-down menu under
           `Input Entity`.
        e. Select ``MySeed`` from `Available Seeds` and click the ``>`` button.

    #. Finally, click `Add Transform` to add your transform to the seed.

Now for the moment of truth, copy the seed URL from the `Paterva TDS console <https://cetas.paterva.com/TDS/seeds>`_ and
add it to Maltego.
